Genes  that were differentially regulated in irr-1 compared to wild-type were analyzed, as well as changes in gene splicing patterns. Overall design: Three biological replicates per genotype (Wt and rrm/irr) per treatment were used. Treatments were: water (untreated) or 1 µM AtPep1 (treated) for 24 hours.
